# ABSTRACT: A user entity that interacts with a web application.

=head1 NAME

Entities::User - A user entity that interacts with a web application.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	used internally, see L<Entities>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A user is an entity that interacts with your webapp. Generally, this is
a human person that has signed up for your service, or was created by
a L<customer|Entities::Customer>, though it could be a privileged bot
or whatever.

The user is that actual entity the performs actions on your webapp, and is
thus required to be authorized to perform the actions they wish to perform.
This is done either by assuming <roles|Entities::Role> or by explicitely
being given <actions|Entities::Action>.

This entity class C<does> the L<Abilities> L<Moose role|Moose::Role>.

NOTE: you are not meant to create user objects directly, but only through
the C<new_user()> method in L<Entities>.

=head1 METHOD MODIFIERS

The following list documents any method modifications performed through
the magic of L<Moose>.

=head2 around qw/roles actions emails/

If the C<roles()>, C<actions()> and C<emails()> methods are called with no arguments
and in list context - will automatically dereference the array-ref into
arrays.

=cut

around qw/roles actions emails/ => sub {
	my ($orig, $self) = (shift, shift);

	if (scalar @_) {
		return $self->$orig(@_);
	} else {
		my $ret = $self->$orig || [];
		return wantarray ? @$ret : $ret;
	}
};

=head2 around BUILDARGS

Called before creating a new instance of Entities::User, this automatically
turns the provided passphrase into an L<MD5 digest|Digest::MD5>.

=cut

around BUILDARGS => sub {
	my ($orig, $class, %params) = @_;

	if ($params{passphrase}) {
		$params{passphrase} = md5_hex($params{passphrase});
	}

	return $class->$orig(%params);
};

=head2 after anything_that_changes_object

Automatically saves the object to the backend after any method that changed
it was executed. Also updates the 'modified' attribute with the current time
before saving. Note, however, that the C<roles()>, C<action()> and
C<emails()> methods are not here, since they are only meant to be used
for writing internally.

=cut

after qw/set_realname set_username set_passphrase add_to_role drop_role grant_action drop_action add_email drop_email/ => sub {
	$_[0]->modified(DateTime->now);
	$_[0]->parent->save($_[0]);
};
