# ABSTRACT: A certain functionality, or just plan feature, that customers can use.

=head1 NAME

Entities::Feature - A certain functionality, or just plan feature, that customers can use.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	used internally, see L<Entities>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A feature is just a name for some functionality or feature in your
webapp, that you want to limit the availability of to certain privileged
customers only. A feature is the basis of L<feature-based authorization|Abilities::Features>.

NOTE: you are not meant to create feature objects directly, but only through
the C<new_feature()> method in L<Entities>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new( name => 'somefeature', [ description => 'Just some feature',
parent => $entities_obj, id => 123, created => $dt, modified => $other_dt ] )

Creates a new instance of this module. Only 'name' is required.

=head2 id()

Returns the ID of the feature, if set.

=head2 has_id()

Returns a true value if the feature has an ID attribute.

=head2 _set_id( $id )

Changes the ID of the feature object to a new ID. Should only be used
internally.

=cut

has 'id' => (
	is => 'ro',
	isa => Any,
	predicate => 'has_id',
	writer => '_set_id'
);

=head2 name()

Returns the name of the feature.

=cut

has 'name' => (
	is => 'ro',
	isa => Str,
	required => 1
);

=head2 description()

Returns the description text of the feature.

=head2 set_description( $desc )

Changes the description of the object to the provided value.

=cut

has 'description' => (
	is => 'ro',
	isa => Str,
	writer => 'set_description'
);

=head2 created()

Returns a L<DateTime> object in the time the feature object has been
created.

=cut

has 'created' => (
	is => 'ro',
	isa => sub { croak 'created must be a DateTime object' unless blessed $_[0] && blessed $_[0] eq 'DateTime' },
	default => sub { DateTime->now() }
);

=head2 modified( [$dt] )

Returns a L<DateTime> object in the last time the feature object has been
modified. If a DateTime object is provided, it will be set as the new
value of this attribute.

=cut

has 'modified' => (
	is => 'rw',
	isa => sub { croak 'modified must be a DateTime object' unless blessed $_[0] && blessed $_[0] eq 'DateTime' },
	default => sub { DateTime->now() }
);

=head2 parent()

Returns the L<Entities::Backend> instance that stores this object.

=cut

has 'parent' => (
	is => 'ro',
	isa => sub { croak 'parent must be an Entities::Backend' unless blessed $_[0] && $_[0]->does('Entities::Backend') },
	weak_ref => 1
);

=head1 METHOD MODIFIERS

The following list documents any method modifications performed through
the magic of L<Moose>.

=head2 after anything_that_changes_object

Automatically saves the object to the backend after any method that changed
it was executed. Also updates the 'modified' attribute with the current time
before saving.

after qw/set_description/ => sub {
	$_[0]->modified(DateTime->now);
	$_[0]->parent->save($_[0]);
};
